 # l. Initiative 
A computer will give the user a number, the user will guess if the number after will be higher or lower than the previous. If the user guesses correctly, the user wins. 



 # ll. Epics and User Stories
 
 
 Epics
 
 
- The computer will display a number between 1 and 10 
- The computer will ask whether the user if they think the next number will be higher or lower
- The user will input either higher or lower
- The computer will now generate another number at random again btween 1 and 10 
- The computer will display that new number
- If the player has guesed correctly a message will be displayed "you win", if they haven't a message will be displayed "you lose"
- If the the computer can't go higher or lower then a message will be displayed "it's a draw"


Non-Functional Requirements


User Stories


- (1) As a player I would like to see what number the computer has picked
- (2) As a player I would like to choose if the next number is higher or lower
- (3) As a player I would like to see the next number that is displayed
- (4) As a player I would like to see a message to tell me if I have won or lost 
- (5) As a player I would like to see a message asking me if I would like to play again
- (6) As a player I would like to see a score function, stating how many times i have guessed correctly and how many times i have guessed incorrectly

How I addresed the requirements

Firstly, I will think about writing the code for the random number that the computer will generate.
