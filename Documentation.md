 # l. Initiative 
A computer will give the user a number, the user will guess if the number after will be higher or lower than the previous. If the user guesses correctly, the user wins. 



 # ll. Epics and User Stories
 
 
 Epics
 
 
- The computer will display a number between 1 and 10 
- The computer will ask whether the user if they think the next number will be higher or lower
- The user will input either higher or lower
- The computer will now generate another number at random again btween 1 and 10 
- The computer will display that new number
- If the player has guesed correctly a message will be displayed "you win", if they haven't a message will be displayed "you lose"
- If the the computer can't go higher or lower then a message will be displayed "it's a draw"


Non-Functional Requirements
- A message can be stated after the game to ask the player if they would like to play again.
- The screen can be cleared once the result has appeared if the user has selected the option where they would like to play again.


User Stories


- (1) As a player I would like to see what number the computer has picked
- (2) As a player I would like to choose if the next number is higher or lower
- (3) As a player I would like to see the next number that is displayed
- (4) As a player I would like to see a message to tell me if I have won or lost 
- (5) As a player I would like to see a message asking me if I would like to play again
- (6) As a player I would like to see a score function, stating how many times i have guessed correctly and how many times i have guessed incorrectly

How I addresed the requirements


# lll. Genre
A simple guessing game

# lV. Technical Details


**Platform**
The website https://repl.it/ was used in the creation of this game. This is an online programming environment where the user can write code very easily.

**Programming Language/Environment**
C++


**Programming Challenges**
- The main challenge I faced was how the computer can generate a random number
- Another challenge was how could generate two different random numbers


**Constructing And Implementing My Code Think of this as the method. How will you go about building your program?**


The first thing that is needed to be thought about is how to implement the random numbers. Some research was needed to be done and then the code would be written to allow this to happen. After, a string would need to be created to allow the user to input their choice Then, the while loop would be created to allow the user to play again.


Algorithms

There are 2 main algorithms for this program. 
 

Coding Standards

- In this program all the curly brackets are opened at the same place
- All the code is indented the same 
-
